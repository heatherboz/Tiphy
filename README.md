# Tiphy

## Description 

Tiphy is a website, at tiphy.herokuapp.com that combines the idea of Tinder with the popular new form of communication, GIPHY, hence the name Tiphy. 

On this website, users primarily are shown gifs from the GIPHY database, and can rate them by saying whether they like them or dislike them. 
All of the user's liked gifs will appear on their profile page, along with their match. 
Users are matched with each other based on their gif preferences, so they can chat with someone who has similar interests. 
Additionally, Tiphy's main page contains the current top-rated gifs to see what everyone is into at the moment.
